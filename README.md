### **Secure Lending Protocol - A Solidity Smart Contract for Decentralized Lending**

#### **Project Description**
The **Secure Lending Protocol** is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform implemented as a Solidity smart contract. It allows users to deposit Ether as collateral, borrow against their deposits, and repay loans securely. Designed with a strong focus on security and efficiency, this contract leverages best practices in smart contract development to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks.

This project can serve as a foundational framework for building advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or educational purposes to understand lending protocols in Ethereum smart contracts.

### **Key Features**
1. **Deposits**: Users can deposit Ether into the protocol, which is tracked as collateral for borrowing.
2. **Borrowing**: Users can borrow Ether, limited to their deposited collateral, ensuring a secure over-collateralized lending mechanism.
3. **Repayments**: Borrowed funds can be repaid to reduce debts and restore collateral balances.
4. **Reentrancy Protection**: Implements a `noReentrancy` modifier to safeguard against reentrancy attacks.
5. **Transparency**: Users can view their balances, debts, and collateral availability through public functions.
6. **Customizability**: The contract is designed to be modular, allowing easy extension for additional features like interest rates or liquidation mechanisms.

### **Security Measures**
- **Reentrancy Protection**: A `noReentrancy` modifier prevents attackers from exploiting callback mechanisms.
- **Collateral Requirements**: Ensures users cannot borrow more than their collateral.
- **Safe Ether Transfers**: Uses low-level `call` with transfer validation for secure Ether transfers.
- **Controlled State Updates**: Balances and debts are updated before any external calls.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Solidity**: Programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Remix IDE**: For development, testing, and deployment.
- **MetaMask**: For interacting with the contract on the Sepolia Test Network.

### **How to Use**
1. **Deposit Ether**: Use the `deposit` function to add Ether as collateral.
2. **Borrow Funds**: Borrow Ether up to the collateral limit using the `borrow` function.
3. **Repay Debt**: Use the `repay` function to repay borrowed Ether and reduce your debt.
4. **View Balances**: Check your collateral and debt using the `getCollateralBalance` function.

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add interest rates for borrowing.
- Implement liquidation mechanisms for under-collateralized loans.
- Integrate with ERC-20 tokens to support token-based lending and borrowing.
- Build a frontend for a user-friendly DeFi interface.

---

### **Deployment**
The contract is deployed and tested on the **Sepolia Test Network**. You can deploy it using Remix IDE and interact with it via MetaMask.
